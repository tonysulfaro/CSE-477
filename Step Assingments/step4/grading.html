<p>Step 3 Grading </p>
<p>Name: Tony Sulfaro</p>
<p>When you have completed the step assignment, complete the following form by entering numbers where the blanks are and
    compute your assignment grade. Include this file as page in your step web site. Enter the number of points you
    deserve for each grading category. You may enter partial points if you feel you have partially completed the
    category.</p>
<p>Total available points: 70 </p>
<p>For each item, if there is a request for the file and line number, indicate that as well so the TA can verify the
    code.</p>
<p>For each of the pages, deduct for elements you were unable to complete as a percentage of the page requirements. List
    the elements you did not complete after the page name.</p>
<p>__10__ 10 Submitted correctly (naming, grading page, etc.)
</p>
<p>__2.5_ 2.5 All pages use present_header to display the header</p>
<p>__2.5_ 2.5 wumpus.inc.php is correctly included</p>
<p>__5___ 5 Cave array correct</p>
<p>__10__ 10 Birds message</p>
<p>__5___ 5 Birds carry you away</p>
<p>__5___ 5 Drafts message</p>
<p>__5___ 5 Lose when falling into pit</p>
<p>__10__ 10 Wumpus</p>
<p>__5___ 5 Lose when wumpus eats you</p>
<p>__5___ 5 Arrows shoot into rooms</p>
<p>__5___ 5 Winning!</p>
<p>__70__ Total (please add the points and include the total here)</p>
<p>The grade you compute is the starting point for course staff, who reserve the right to change the grade if they
    disagree with your assessment and to deduct points for other issues they may encounter, such as errors in the
    submission process, naming issues, etc.</p>
<p>The rule for grading forms is this: If you indicate that you have done a task on the grading form and you have not
    actually done the task, the TA will deduct <strong>double the number of points</strong>. </p>
